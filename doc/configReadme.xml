This Anypoint template serves as a foundation for setting an online sync of products from Salesforce to SAP S/4HANA.

Use this template if would like to sync products from Salesforce to SAP S/4HANA products in manner of one time synchronization by browse toting the HTTP endpoint. The template will fetch all products by specified criteria and send it as to SAP S/4HANA to create/update products there.
Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this template leverages the Mule batch module.
The batch job is divided into *Process* and *On Complete* stages.
The integration is triggered by the HTTP endpoint to fetch all the Salesforce Products suitable for migration.
Fetched products are passed to the batch as input. In the batch the products is fetched from SAP S/4HANA by its name.
If it exists, its products identifier is resolved against SAP S/4HANA. If it doesn't exist, then new product number is fetched from SAP S/4HANA.
Afterwards every such product from Salesforce is sent to SAP S/4HANA where it is asynchronously updated or created.
Finally during the *On Complete* stage the template logs output statistics data into the console and send a notification e-mail with the results of the batch execution.

​To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made for the template to run smoothly.
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before using this template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](https://docs.mulesoft.com/connectors/sap/sap-s4hana-cloud-connector), that will teach you how to work
with SAP S/4HANA and Anypoint Studio.

After you import your template into Anypoint Studio, follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources.
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the "Properties to Configure" section.
+ Right click the template project folder.
+ Hover your mouse over `Run as`.
+ Click `Mule Application (configure)`.
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `mule.env` to the value `dev`.
+ Click `Run`.

In order to make this template run on Anypoint Studio there are a few extra steps that needs to be made.

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateproducts` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.

Functional aspect of the template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of executing the logic.
For the purpose of this particular template the *mainFlow* just executes the Batch Job which handles all the logic of it.
This flow has Error Handling that basically consists on invoking the *On Error Propagate Component* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
